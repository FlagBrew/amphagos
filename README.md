Golem is an API wrapper library for the [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) V2 API, built in Golang


# Notice

This was built on Linux, so knowing my luck, it probably won't behave nicely on Windows.

If you do find an issue with using it on Windows or MacOS please let me know in the issues page.

# Using this library

First you'll want to do a go get

``go get github.com/flagbrew/golem``

Then you'll to import it into your application, once there the syntax is

golem.Get(Object)()

To see a list of available objects, you can find the documentation for the API [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.html/)


# Defaults

The default location for the cached data is $HomeDirectory/.golem/ you are able to change this with the SetCachePath() command


# Reporting bugs

I've done my best to test everything, but of course something probably will have slipped by.

If you find any bugs with this library, please report it on the issues page.

When reporting a bug, try to be as descriptive as possible, thank you.
